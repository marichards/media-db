* Todo:
- Design and create header, footer, and nav bar
- Polish style
- Add external links to Kegg, etc.
- Research authentication capabilities for django
- alphabetize compounds (also needed on biomass_detail)

Wednesday: talk with Matt about style, presentation, etc.

** Search:
- test suite?
- Partition results based on class
- Paginate Results?
  
** Things (Detail Pages):
ORGANISM_RECORD:
-Organism genus, species, strain
-List of links to media the organism grows in
-List of sources linked to that organism
-Histogram showing most frequent compounds in media for that organism
-Link to the NCBI project for that genome sequence

MEDIA_RECORD:
-List of links to compounds in the media, listed next to the amount of each compound (in mM)
-List of links to organisms that grow in that media
-Link to source for the media

COMPOUND_RECORD:
-List of all the compound names
-KEGG ID, BiGG ID, SEED ID
-Number of media that compound appears in , plus a list of their names (first 50) or maybe a link to a list of their names

SOURCE_RECORD:
-Last name of the first author
-Journal of publication
-Year 
-Article title
-Link to online source

BIOMASS_RECORD:
-Name (genus+species) of organism
-List of links to compounds in the biomass, listed next to the amount of each compound (in mM)
-Link to source for the biomass

GROWTH_RECORD:
-Link to organism record
-Link to media record
-Link to source record
-Growth rate, pH, temperature
-Secretion and uptake rates associated with the growth rate, with units

* Done:
- Design and create header, footer, and nav bar
- Create paged displays (eg, for organism)
** Search:
- Get list of searchable classes from Matt; implement keywords(self) for each
- Create search page/block/widget (input)
- Define a search result block
- Include search form on search results page (ie, combine search.html and searchresults.html)
- Implement 'LIKE' matches
