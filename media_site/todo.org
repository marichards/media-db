* Todo:
- Add new organism form
- Add custom users/authentication (do a side project?)
- Add ISB styling (and then styling in general)
- still a few small things in /mnt/price3/Matt/Media DB Project/minor website fixes.txt
- put in collapsable fields for things like media compounds, search results, etc.
- editing of existing gd records
- want to be able to search growth-data records?
