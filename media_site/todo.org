* Todo:
- Add new organism form
- Add custom users/authentication (do a side project?)
- Add ISB styling (and then styling in general)
- still a few small things in /mnt/price3/Matt/Media DB Project/minor website fixes.txt
- put in collapsable fields for things like media compounds, search results, etc.
- want to be able to search growth-data records?

** editing of existing gd records
- Either:
- - alter newmedia_form.html to include loops to display *all* data in form, including 
    variable number of comp/amount and secretion/uptake data, from the beginning 
- Or:
- - use existing add_compound, add_uptake to add after the fact; 
- - would required post-load ajax call to get the rest of the data
- - have to alter add_compound and add_uptake to take params to add, and insert them in to
    new html.  Might be easier to just write two new functions; or possibly call existing 
    funcs to add the blank rows, then afterwards add the values
