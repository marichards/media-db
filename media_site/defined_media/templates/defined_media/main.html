<h2>ACRONYM is a SQL database that can be browsed </h2>

<p>ACRONYM is a database aimed at bringing together genomic information and organism growth data.  As the wealth of sequence information continues to grow, there is an expanding pool of publically-avaiable genomic data.  A possible application for these data is to elucidate defined media to culture the so-called "uncultured majority" of organisms that have not yet been isolated in a laboratory setting.  ACRONYM brings together fully-sequenced organisms and their associated chemically-defined media as reported in primary literature sources.  Our hope is that this set of experimentally-verified data will establish a knowledgebase of media-genome connections that will expand and aid in media formulation development. </p>

<p>Media formulations and genomic data also feed into the field of constraint-based metabolic modeling, in which the genome is related to metabolism through gene-protein-reaction relationships and used to create a model that simulates growth on a particular media formulation.  ACRONYM was formed with a strong emphasis on constraint-based modeling and contains data for the majority of organisms with existing in silico models (<a href='http://gcrg.ucsd.edu/InSilicoOrganisms/OtherOrganisms'>Palsson reference</a>).  The information in ACRONYM provides a wealth of media conditions that can contribute to model creation and refinement efforts. </p>
  
<p>ACRONYM was created by the Price lab at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, WA and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  </p>


<h2>How To Use ACRONYM</h2>

<p>For the most part, ACRONYM is very simple to use.  You can browse the data via the website, or download the entire data <a href='{% url 'downloads' %}'>here</a>.</p>
